  description: |-
    Switches Better Thermostat between its comfort temperature and a set-back eco temperature, based on persons' presence and a schedule. 

    Restores the Better Thermostat's comfort temperature when:
    * the schedule is on, and
    * at least one person is at home.

    Sets a configured set-back eco temperature when:
    * the schedule is off, or
    * all the persons are not at home.
